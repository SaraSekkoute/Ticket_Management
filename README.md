I know I have done a lot of things, like hashing passwords, searching by ticket ID and status, doing tests, and implementing many features that I haven't used.  
I know that, but I didnâ€™t have time to check my code.  
I know that too, but I didn't have time to do it before the deadline.  
However, I can explain all of this if you want. :)
